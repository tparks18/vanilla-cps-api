## Overview
This project is a simple web application built with **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript** that pulls data directly from the **Chicago Public Schools (CPS) API**. It does **not** use web scraping—only API requests to retrieve structured data.

## What is an API?
Think of an **API (Application Programming Interface)** like a **waiter** in a restaurant. When you place an order (make a request), the waiter (API) takes it to the kitchen (server), retrieves your food (data), and delivers it back to you. This project interacts with the CPS API in the same way—requesting data and displaying it on a webpage.

## Features
* Fetches data directly from the CPS API
* Displays information dynamically using JavaScript  
* Simple, lightweight, and easy to customize

## Technologies Used
* **HTML** for structure
* **CSS** for styling
* **Vanilla JavaScript** for API interaction

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cps-api-vanilla.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in a browser.

3. The page will automatically fetch and display CPS data.
